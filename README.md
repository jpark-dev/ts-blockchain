# ts-blockchain

A simple blockchain creating application written in TypeScript.

Creating blockchain is not easy, it contains data that needs to be crypted, and sometimes, a multiple of data in different data type need to be serialized.

This is where TypeScript can play a pivotal role here, it will help developers from errors and bugs arise from data-type checks, argument numbers, return data type... it even tell developers what data should be there right after the flashing cursor on their screen!

## Dependencies
